These two architectures have been validated in DeepSeekV2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), demonstrating their capability to maintain robust model performance while achieving efficient training and inference. Beyond the basic architecture, we implement two additional strategies to further enhance the model capabilities. Firstly, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) for load balancing, with the aim of minimizing the adverse impact on model performance that arises from the effort to encourage load balancing.

Low-precision training has emerged as a promising solution for efficient training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Kalamkar et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2023b), its evolution being closely tied to advancements in hardware capabilities (Luo et al., 2024; Micikevicius et al., 2022; Rouhani et al., 2023a). In this work, we introduce an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate its effectiveness on an extremely large-scale model. Through the support for FP8 computation and storage, we achieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage. As for the training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism, which has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through computation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead. In addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize InfiniBand (IB) and NVLink bandwidths.

In domains where verification through external tools is straightforward, such as some coding or mathematics scenarios, RL demonstrates exceptional efficacy. However, in more general scenarios, constructing a feedback mechanism through hard coding is impractical. During the development of DeepSeek-V3, for these broader contexts, we employ the constitutional AI approach (Bai et al., 2022), leveraging the voting evaluation results of DeepSeek-V3 itself as a feedback source. This method has produced notable alignment effects, significantly enhancing the performance of DeepSeek-V3 in subjective evaluations. By integrating additional constitutional inputs, DeepSeek-V3 can optimize towards the constitutional direction. We believe that this paradigm, which combines supplementary information with LLMs as a feedback source, is of paramount importance. The LLM serves as a versatile processor capable of transforming unstructured information from diverse scenarios into rewards, ultimately facilitating the self-improvement of LLMs. Beyond self-rewarding, we are also dedicated to uncovering other general and scalable rewarding methods to consistently advance the model capabilities in general scenarios.

The post-training also makes a success in distilling the reasoning capability from the DeepSeek-R1 series of models.

A similar process is also required for the activation gradient. A straightforward strategy is to apply block-wise quantization per $128\\\\mathrm{x}128$ elements like the way we quantize the model weights. In this way, only transposition is required for backward. Therefore, we conduct an experiment where all tensors associated with Dgrad are quantized on a block-wise basis. The results reveal that the Dgrad operation which computes the activation gradients and back-propagates to shallow layers in a chain-like manner, is highly sensitive to precision. Specifically, block-wise quantization of activation gradients leads to model divergence on an MoE model comprising approximately 16B total parameters, trained for around 300B tokens. We hypothesize that this sensitivity arises because activation gradients are highly imbalanced among tokens, resulting in token-correlated outliers (Xi et al., 2023). These outliers cannot be effectively managed by a block-wise quantization approach. ', 'page_idx': 46}, children=[])])]), Content(type='chapter', level=0, data={'type': 'text', 'text': 'C.

These two architectures have been validated in DeepSeekV2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), demonstrating their capability to maintain robust model performance while achieving efficient training and inference. Beyond the basic architecture, we implement two additional strategies to further enhance the model capabilities. Firstly, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) for load balancing, with the aim of minimizing the adverse impact on model performance that arises from the effort to encourage load balancing.

In this work, we introduce an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate its effectiveness on an extremely large-scale model. Through the support for FP8 computation and storage, we achieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage. As for the training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism, which has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through computation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead. In addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize InfiniBand (IB) and NVLink bandwidths.

Further exploration of this approach across different domains remains an important direction for future research. \"}}]}, {\"type\": \"chapter\", \"level\": 2, \"data\": {\"text\": \"5.4.2.

In domains where verification through external tools is straightforward, such as some coding or mathematics scenarios, RL demonstrates exceptional efficacy. However, in more general scenarios, constructing a feedback mechanism through hard coding is impractical. During the development of DeepSeek-V3, for these broader contexts, we employ the constitutional AI approach (Bai et al., 2022), leveraging the voting evaluation results of DeepSeek-V3 itself as a feedback source. This method has produced notable alignment effects, significantly enhancing the performance of DeepSeek-V3 in subjective evaluations. By integrating additional constitutional inputs, DeepSeek-V3 can optimize towards the constitutional direction. We believe that this paradigm, which combines supplementary information with LLMs as a feedback source, is of paramount importance. The LLM serves as a versatile processor capable of transforming unstructured information from diverse scenarios into rewards, ultimately facilitating the self-improvement of LLMs. Beyond self-rewarding, we are also dedicated to uncovering other general and scalable rewarding methods to consistently advance the model capabilities in general scenarios. \"}}]}, {\"type\": \"chapter\", \"level\": 2, \"data\": {\"text\": \"5.4.3.

Combined with the framework of speculative decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023), it can significantly accelerate the decoding speed of the model. A natural question arises concerning the acceptance rate of the additionally predicted token. Based on our evaluation, the acceptance rate of the second token prediction ranges between $85\\\\%$ and $90\\\\%$ across various generation topics, demonstrating consistent reliability. This high acceptance rate enables DeepSeek-V3 to achieve a significantly improved decoding speed, delivering 1.8 times TPS (Tokens Per Second). \"}}]}]}]}, {\"type\": \"chapter\", \"level\": 0, \"data\": {\"text\": \"6.

In addition to the MLA and DeepSeekMoE architectures, it also pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. The training of DeepSeek-V3 is cost-effective due to the support of FP8 training and meticulous engineering optimizations. The post-training also makes a success in distilling the reasoning capability from the DeepSeek-R1 series of models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-V3 has emerged as the strongest open-source model currently available, and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Despite its strong performance, it also maintains economical training costs. It requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training, including pre-training, context length extension, and post-training. \"}}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"level\": 1, \"data\": {\"text\": \"While acknowledging its strong performance and cost-effectiveness, we also recognize that DeepSeek-V3 has some limitations, especially on the deployment.

A similar process is also required for the activation gradient. A straightforward strategy is to apply block-wise quantization per $128\\\\mathrm{x}128$ elements like the way we quantize the model weights. In this way, only transposition is required for backward. Therefore, we conduct an experiment where all tensors associated with Dgrad are quantized on a block-wise basis. The results reveal that the Dgrad operation which computes the activation gradients and back-propagates to shallow layers in a chain-like manner, is highly sensitive to precision. Specifically, block-wise quantization of activation gradients leads to model divergence on an MoE model comprising approximately 16B total parameters, trained for around 300B tokens. We hypothesize that this sensitivity arises because activation gradients are highly imbalanced among tokens, resulting in token-correlated outliers (Xi et al., 2023). These outliers cannot be effectively managed by a block-wise quantization approach. \"}}]}]}, {\"type\": \"chapter\", \"level\": 0, \"data\": {\"text\": \"C.

To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks.

Beyond closed-source models, open-source models, including DeepSeek series (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a,b,c; Guo et al., 2024), LLaMA series (AI@Meta, $2024\\\\mathsf{a},\\\\mathsf{b},$ ; Touvron et al., 2023a,b), Qwen series (Qwen, 2023, 2024a,b), and Mistral series (Jiang et al., 2023; Mistral, 2024), are also making significant strides, endeavoring to close the gap with their closed-source counterparts. To further push the boundaries of open-source model capabilities, we scale up our models and introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 671B parameters, of which 37B are activated for each token. \"}}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"level\": 1, \"data\": {\"text\": \"With a forward-looking perspective, we consistently strive for strong model performance and economical costs. Therefore, in terms of architecture, DeepSeek-V3 still adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) for efficient inference and DeepSeekMoE (Dai et al., 2024) for cost-effective training. These two architectures have been validated in DeepSeekV2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), demonstrating their capability to maintain robust model performance while achieving efficient training and inference. Beyond the basic architecture, we implement two additional strategies to further enhance the model capabilities. Firstly, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) for load balancing, with the aim of minimizing the adverse impact on model performance that arises from the effort to encourage load balancing. Secondly, DeepSeek-V3 employs a multi-token prediction training objective, which we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks. \"}}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"level\": 1, \"data\": {\"text\": \"In order to achieve efficient training, we support the FP8 mixed precision training and implement comprehensive optimizations for the training framework. Low-precision training has emerged as a promising solution for efficient training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Kalamkar et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2023b), its evolution being closely tied to advancements in hardware capabilities (Luo et al., 2024; Micikevicius et al., 2022; Rouhani et al., 2023a). In this work, we introduce an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate its effectiveness on an extremely large-scale model. Through the support for FP8 computation and storage, we achieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage. As for the training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism, which has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through computation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead. In addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize InfiniBand (IB) and NVLink bandwidths. Furthermore, we meticulously optimize the memory footprint, making it possible to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly tensor parallelism.

For MoE models, an unbalanced expert load will lead to routing collapse (Shazeer et al., 2017) and diminish computational efficiency in scenarios with expert parallelism.

However, too large an auxiliary loss will impair the model performance (Wang et al., 2024a). To achieve a better trade-off between load balance and model performance, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) to ensure load balance.

We also recommend supporting a warp-level cast instruction for speedup, which further facilitates the better fusion of layer normalization and FP8 cast. Alternatively, a near-memory computing approach can be adopted, where compute logic is placed near the HBM. In this case, BF16 elements can be cast to FP8 directly as they are read from HBM into the GPU, reducing off-chip memory access by roughly $50\\\\%$ . \"}}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"level\": 3, \"data\": {\"text\": \"Support for Transposed GEMM Operations. The current architecture makes it cumbersome to fuse matrix transposition with GEMM operations. In our workflow, activations during the forward pass are quantized into 1x128 FP8 tiles and stored. During the backward pass, the matrix needs to be read out, dequantized, transposed, re-quantized into 128x1 tiles, and stored in HBM. To reduce memory operations, we recommend future chips to enable direct transposed reads of matrices from shared memory before MMA operation, for those precisions required in both training and inference. Combined with the fusion of FP8 format conversion and TMA access, this enhancement will significantly streamline the quantization workflow. \"}}]}]}]}```\n",

A similar process is also required for the activation gradient. A straightforward strategy is to apply block-wise quantization per $128\\\\mathrm{x}128$ elements like the way we quantize the model weights. In this way, only transposition is required for backward. Therefore, we conduct an experiment where all tensors associated with Dgrad are quantized on a block-wise basis. The results reveal that the Dgrad operation which computes the activation gradients and back-propagates to shallow layers in a chain-like manner, is highly sensitive to precision. Specifically, block-wise quantization of activation gradients leads to model divergence on an MoE model comprising approximately 16B total parameters, trained for around 300B tokens. We hypothesize that this sensitivity arises because activation gradients are highly imbalanced among tokens, resulting in token-correlated outliers (Xi et al., 2023). These outliers cannot be effectively managed by a block-wise quantization approach. \"}}]}]}```\n",

      " - DeepSeek-V3 was trained on a cluster with 2048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, interconnected via NVLink and InfiniBand.\n",
      " - The training framework uses 16-way Pipeline Parallelism, 64-way Expert Parallelism, and ZeRO-1 Data Parallelism.\n",
      " - DualPipe algorithm overlaps computation and communication phases to reduce pipeline bubbles.\n",
      " - Efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels minimize communication overhead.\n",
      " - The training framework prioritizes memory saving techniques, including recomputation of RMSNorm and shared embedding/output heads.\n",
      " - FP8 training utilizes a mixed-precision framework to improve training speed and reduce memory usage.\n",
      " - The framework employs tile- and block-wise quantization to mitigate quantization errors.\n",
      " - The inference deployment separates prefilling and decoding stages for improved throughput.\n",
      " - Suggestions for hardware design include improvements to communication and compute hardware, particularly focusing on enhancing FP8 GEMM accumulation precision and supporting online quantization.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "4. Pre-Training\n",
      " - The pre-training corpus was optimized by enhancing mathematical and programming samples and expanding multilingual coverage.\n",
      " - The data processing pipeline was refined to minimize redundancy while maintaining corpus diversity.\n",
      " - The Prefix-Suffix-Middle (PSM) framework, employing the Fill-in-Middle (FIM) strategy at a rate of 0.1, structures data.\n",
      " - A tokenizer with a 128K token vocabulary was used, with combined punctuation/line break tokens split to mitigate token boundary bias.\n",
      " - Hyperparameters include 61 Transformer layers, a hidden dimension of 3768, and 37B activated parameters per token.\n",
      " - Training involved a multi-stage learning rate schedule and a batch size scheduling strategy.\n",
      " - Long context extension used YaRN to progressively expand the context window to 128K.\n",
      " - The MTP strategy consistently enhances model performance on most benchmarks.\n",
      " - The auxiliary-loss-free balancing strategy demonstrates better model performance compared to purely auxiliary-loss-based methods.\n",
      " - Batch-wise balancing enables greater expert specialization patterns and faces efficiency challenges addressed by the training framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "5. Post-Training \n",
      " - Curated instruction-tuning datasets include 1.5M instances spanning multiple domains, employing domain-specific data creation methods. Expert models generate reasoning data, balancing accuracy with clarity and conciseness. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) uses system prompts to guide responses and incorporates chain-of-thought patterns. Reinforcement Learning (RL) utilizes Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize policy models. A rule-based Reward Model (RM) is used for verifiable tasks, while a model-based RM is used for free-form responses, incorporating chain-of-thought into the reward model.\n",
      " - The reward model is trained from DeepSeek-V3 SFT checkpoints to enhance reliability.\n",
      " - DeepSeek-V3 demonstrates competitive performance against leading models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet in code and math benchmarks.\n",
      " - Distillation from DeepSeek-R1 enhances model performance but increases response length, requiring careful setting of distillation parameters.\n",
      " - DeepSeek-V3 uses self-rewarding, leveraging its own voting results as feedback, leading to significant alignment effects.\n",
      " - Multi-Token Prediction enhances decoding speed, achieving a token acceptance rate of 2.\n",
      " - In open-ended evaluation DeepSeek-V3 shows strong performance against leading models\n",
      "\n",

      " - DeepSeek-V3 is a 671B parameter MoE model trained on 14.8T tokens, incorporating MLA, DeepSeekMoE, auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, and a multi-token prediction training objective.\n",
      " - Training cost was 2.788M H800 GPU hours.\n",
      " - DeepSeek-V3 demonstrates performance comparable to leading closed-source models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet) while remaining cost-effective.\n",
      " - A limitation is the relatively large deployment unit required for efficient inference.\n",
      " - Future research directions include architectural improvements, increased data quantity and quality, enhancement of deep thinking capabilities, and development of more comprehensive evaluation methods.\n",

      "B. Ablation Studies for Low-Precision Training\n",
      " - FP8 mixed precision training was validated against BF16 training on baseline models of varying scales (16B and 230B parameters).\n",
      " - Relative error remained below 0.25% with high-precision accumulation and fine-grained quantization.\n",
      " - Block-wise quantization of activation gradients led to model divergence, likely due to sensitivity to imbalanced activation gradients and token-correlated outliers.\n",

    "**Objective:** Analyze the 'Current Chapter Content'. Your **sole focus** is to extract and synthesize the **absolute core knowledge** (key findings, critical methods/definitions, essential results, crucial context) presented within.
