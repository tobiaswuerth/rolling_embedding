This approach yields personalized clusters without needing to access the entire graph, which makes it highly suitable for numerous applications involving large graphs. However, most existing solutions merely rely on the topological connectivity between nodes in G, rendering them vulnerable to missing or noisy links that are commonly present in real-world graphs. To address this issue, this paper resorts to leveraging the complementary nature of graph topology and node attributes to enhance local clustering quality. To effectively exploit the attribute information, we first formulate the LGC as an esti- mation of the bidirectional diffusion distribution(BDD), which is specialized for capturing the multi-hop affinity between nodes in the presence of attributes. Furthermore, we propose LACA, an efficient and effective approach for LGC that achieves superb empirical performance on multiple real datasets while maintaining strong locality. The core components ofLACA include (i) a fast and theoretically-grounded preprocessing technique for node attributes, (ii) an adaptive algorithm for diffusing any vectors over G with rigorous theoretical guarantees and expedited convergence, and (iii) an effective three-step scheme for BDD approximation.

I NTRODUCTION Local graph clustering (LGC) seeks to identify a single cluster (a.k.a. local cluster) pertinent to a given seed node by exploring a small region around it in the input graph. Com- pared to its global counterparts, LGC runs in time proportional to the size of its resulting cluster, regardless of the overall size of the input graph, making it particularly suitable for analyzing large-scale graphs, such as social networks, online shopping graphs, biological networks, and more. In practice, LGC finds extensive applications in various domains, including commu- nity detection or recommendation on social media [1]–[3], protein grouping in bioinformatics [4], [5], product return or user action prediction [6]–[8] on e-commerce platforms, and many others [9]–[13]. Canonical solutions for LGC [14]–[17] are predominantly based on random walk-based graph diffusion models [18], where the main idea is to spread mass from the seed node to other nodes along the edges. This methodology offers high scalability and rigorous theoretical guarantees for complex- ity and output cluster size, but it is extremely sensitive to structural heterogeneities (e.g., high-degree nodes) in real networks, as pinpointed in [19], [20]. To mitigate this is- sue, subsequent LGC works [20]–[22] formulate LGC as a combinatorial optimization problem and leverage max flow algorithms to derive the “optimal” local clusters.

Most importantly, the above algorithms primarily focus on optimizing connectivity-based clustering quality metrics [23]. Real graphs are often constructed from data riddled with noise and thus encompass substantial noisy or missing links, leading to high ground-truth conductance [23], e.g., 0.765 for Flickr and 0.649 for Yelp. Consequently, applying classic LGC techniques to such graphs leads to sub-optimal performance, e.g, often low precisions below 30% (see Table V). As a partial remedy, recent efforts [24]–[27] incorporate higher- order connectivity patterns (e.g., motifs) into the LGC frame- works for improved clustering. However, they still rely solely on graph topology and are therefore vulnerable to missing or noisy nodes/edges. Moreover, these methods suffer from severe efficiency issues as they require enumerating the motifs in graphs in the pre-processing or on the fly. In real life, graphs are often endowed with rich nodal attributes, e.g., user profiles in social networks and paper ab- stracts in citation graphs. These are termed attributed graphs. Recent studies [28]–[30] have corroborated that node attributes provide information that can effectively complement the graph topology for better performance in various tasks. Inspired by this, a straightforward idea is to exploit the attribute information to enhance LGC performance whilst retaining the locality. Very recently, several attempts [31]–[33] have been made to extend classic LGC techniques to attributed graphs by simply re-weighting each edge by the attribute similarity of its endpoints.

Specifically, LACA formulates the LGC task as a seeded random walk diffusion over graphs based on the novel notion of bidirectional diffusion distribution (BDD), an attribute-aware affinity measure dedicated to node pairs in attributed graphs. The main idea is to model the affinity between any node pair (vs, vt) as the expected normalized (exponential) cosine similarity (hereafter SNAS) between the attributes of ending node pairs of random walks originating from vs and vt, which essentially evaluates their meeting probability from the perspectives of both of them through random walks and attribute-based transitions. Accordingly, given a seed node vs, the goal of LGC is to find a local cluster containing nodes with the highest BDD values w.r.t. vs. The exact computation of BDD incurs a significant cost of up to O(n3) as there are n × n possible ending node pairs from random walks starting at the seed node and any of the n nodes. This is non-local and infeasible for large graphs. In response, we develop an adaptive framework for an approximate solution with a runtime linear to the output size and independent of the size of the graph. First, we obtain a fast and theoretically grounded decomposition of the SNAS matrix into low-dimensional feature vectors through randomized tech- niques [34], [35]. This step enables the decoupling of the BDD computation and transforms the problem into the diffusion of vectors over input graphs.

B. Community Search Community search aims to search densely connected com- munities for a user-specified query [73], [74]. Similar to local clustering, community search is query-dependent and does not need to compute the graph globally. Researchers have devised different community models to define densely connected communities, including the most popular ones: k- core [75]–[77] and k-truss [78]–[80]. To incorporate attribute cohesiveness apart from structure cohesiveness, in recent years, a series of works [66], [80]–[83] on community search over attributed graphs have been developed. These methods usually consider keywords as the attributes of the nodes. Among these, ACQ [66], [81] and ATC [82] apply a core- based and a truss-based approach, respectively, both of which aimed at maximizing the number of keywords matching the query in the resulting community. Our approach differs as we do not use the intersections of keywords as the metric of attribute similarity. Although VAC [80] relaxes restrictions on using keywords as attributes, it still diverges from ours in both the objective and the method for calculating attribute similarity, especially in its repetitive computation to derive the minimum attribute similarity in the best k-truss.

Similar to local clustering, community search is query-dependent and does not need to compute the graph globally. Researchers have devised different community models to define densely connected communities,\n",

To incorporate attribute cohesiveness apart from structure cohesiveness, in recent years, a series of works [66], [80]–[83] on community search over attributed graphs have been developed.\n",

Moreover, these methods usually require offline index construction to enhance query processing speed, resulting in significant time and space overheads [32]. In contrast, our approach follows the LGC methods and designs an efficient attribute similarity computation method, eliminating the need for indices. Therefore, the problem setting of our work is orthogonal to that of community search. VIII. C ONCLUSION In this paper, we present LACA, an effective approach that leverages node attributes to improve the LGC quality on attributed graphs. LACA achieves remarkable performance through four major contributions: (i) a novel problem formu- lation based on the novel node affinity measure BDD, (ii) an adaptive RWR-based graph diffusion algorithm with faster convergence, (iii) a highly scalable preprocessing technique that enables problem reduction, and (iv) a well-thought-out three-step scheme for BDD approximation. The superiority of LACA over 17 baselines is experimentally validated over 8 real datasets in terms of both clustering quality and practical efficiency. Regarding future work, we plan to study the local clustering on heterophilic graphs. 12REFERENCES [1] C. Karras, A. Karras, I. Giannoukou, K. C. Giotopoulos, D. Tsolis, and S.

In comparison, on social networks BlogCL and Flickr, a remarkable improvement and reduction in performance can be observed when k increases from 8 to 32 and from 32 to d, respectively. The reason is that both BlogCL and Flickr have numerous distinct attributes in X (d = 8, 189 and d = 12, 047), which embody substantial noisy information. Meanwhile, our k-SVD essentially denoises attribute data by extracting k key components.

Particularly, the variants of LACA (C) and LACA (E) without AdaptiveDiffuse are implemented using GreedyDiffuse as the diffusion component. Table VI reports the best precision scores attained by each method on 8 datasets. We can see remarkable performance decreases in both LACA (C) and LACA (E) after disabling any of these three ingredients, especially the SNAS. The only exception is on Amazon2M, where LACA (C) achieves a better result when SNAS is removed from BDD, whereas LACA (E) exhibits a radically different phenomenon. This indicates that the exponential cosine similarity is more robust in modelling the similarity of node attributes.

The remarkable superiority of the BDD over the alternatives is due to the fact that these alternatives overly incorporate the attribute similarity (at least two attribute-only transitions) and topological connectivity (three random walk steps) into the random walk diffusion process, rendering the graph traversal rather biased and easier to jump to the nodes that are distant or even disconnected from the seed node vs via the intermediate nodes with high attribute similarities and long random walks. In turn, it is more likely to produce nodes that are far-reaching from the local cluster around vs. 2) Alternative Choices on Similarity Measurements: To further demonstrate the superiority of LACA (C) and LACA (E), we have conducted an ablation study that employs the Jaccard and Pearson correlation coefficients as the SNAS in LACA (C) and LACA (E) on all datasets. Note that the Jaccard coefficient requires the attribute values to be binary and thus are not applicable to datasets with continuous attributes, i.e., PubMed, ArXiv, Yelp, Reddit, and Amazon2M and the Pearson correla- tion coefficient is unable to report the results on large graphs within three days due to the high complexity ( O(n2d)) needed for calculating the similarities of the intermediate node\n",

Other Related Work 1) Attributed Network Embedding: Attributed network em- bedding (ANE) is to embed each node graph G into a low- dimensional feature vector, preserving both topology and attribute information. The obtained embeddings can be used in many downstream tasks, including graph clustering. ANE methods can be categorized into two types: factorization- based and learning-based. Factorization-based methods [61], [89]–[91] construct and factorize node proximity matrices that integrate graph topology and node attributes to derive low- dimensional vectors. TADW [89] leverages a second-order ad- jacency matrix, AANE [90] matches node representations with attribute proximities, PANE [60], [61] optimizes forward and backward affinity matrices via random walks and optimizes convergence with greedy initial technique. However, these methods suffer from scalability issues due to the necessity 20of factorization of an n × n proximity matrix. Learning- based methods [38], [62], [92], [93] are further classified into encoder-decoder and propagation categories. Encoder-decoder methods, including DANE [93] and ANRL [92], integrate attribute features and graph topology by utilizing multiple au- toencoders to minimize input reconstruction loss. Additionally, ANRL develops an attribute-aware model based on the Skip- gram model [94]. CFANE [62] integrates propagation-based and encoder-decoder methods, utilizing self-attention to refine its model. In contrast to our local-based approach, these ANE methods typically require processing nodes across the entire graph. 21\n",
