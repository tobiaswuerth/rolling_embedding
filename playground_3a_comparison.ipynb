In this paper, we combine the quantum gam e with the problem of data clustering, and then develop a quantum-g ame-based clustering algorithm, in which data points in a dataset are c onsidered as players who can make decisions and implement quantum stra tegies in quantum games. After each round of a quantum game, each playe r’s ex- pected payoﬀ is calculated. Later, he uses an link-removing -and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust the streng th of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoﬀ.

Successes achieved by quantum algorithms make us guess that pow erful quantum computers can ﬁgure out solutions faster and better th an the best known classical counterparts for certain types of problems.

In this paper, we combine the quantum gam e with the problem of data clustering, and then develop a quantum-g ame-based clustering algorithm, in which data points in a dataset are c onsidered as players who can make decisions and implement quantum stra tegies in quantum games. After each round of a quantum game, each playe r’s ex- pected payoﬀ is calculated. Later, he uses an link-removing -and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust the streng th of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoﬀ. Further, a lgorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two pa yoﬀ ma- trixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered rea sonably and eﬃciently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provid es an indica- tion of the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach.

During quantum games, the str ucture of network and the strength of links between players tend toward st ability grad- ually.

In quantum computation, the Boolean states 0 and 1 are r epresented by a prescribed pair of normalized and mutually orthogonal quantum st ates labeled as {|0⟩, |1⟩} to form a ’computational basis’ [20]. Any pure state of the qubit can be written as a superposition state α|0⟩+ β|1⟩ for some α and β satisfying |α|2 + |β|2 = 1 [20].

Γ t(i) = Li ( ˆzt− 1(i) ) = argmaxk j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) S Υ t− 1(i) ({ zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) }) ˆzt− 1(i) = { zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) } , Υ t− 1(i) = ⋃ j∈ Γ + t− 1 (i) Γ t− 1(j) Γ + t− 1(i) = { j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θt− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) } , Γ − t− 1(i) = Γ t− 1(i)\\Γ + t− 1(i) (13) where θt− 1(i) is a payoﬀ threshold, Υ t− 1(i) is called an extended neighbor set, and the function argmaxk(·) is to ﬁnd k neighbors with the ﬁrst k largest payoﬀs in the set Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i). Here, two LRR functions L1 i(·) and L2 i(·) are designed. The function L1 i(·) always observes an extended neighbor set formed by half neighbor s of a data 7point X i, α = ⌈ 0.5 × | Γ t− 1(i)| ⌉ , where the symbol ⌈·⌉ is to take an integer part of a number satisfying\n",

Deﬁnition 3The LRR function Li(·) is a function of payoﬀs, whose output is a set with k elements, namely an updated neighbor set Γ t(i) of a player Xi. It is given as below. Γ t(i) = Li ( ˆzt− 1(i) ) = argmaxk j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) S Υ t− 1(i) ({ zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) }) ˆzt− 1(i) = { zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) } , Υ t− 1(i) = ⋃ j∈ Γ + t− 1 (i) Γ t− 1(j) Γ + t− 1(i) = { j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θt− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) } , Γ − t− 1(i) = Γ t− 1(i)\\Γ + t− 1(i) (13) where θt− 1(i) is a payoﬀ threshold, Υ t− 1(i) is called an extended neighbor set, and the function argmaxk(·) is to ﬁnd k neighbors with the ﬁrst k largest payoﬀs in the set Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i). Here, two LRR functions L1 i(·) and L2 i(·) are designed. The function L1 i(·) always observes an extended neighbor set formed by half neighbor s of a data 7point X i, α = ⌈ 0.5 × | Γ t− 1(i)| ⌉ , where the symbol ⌈·⌉ is to take an integer part of a number satisfying the integer part is no larger than the nu mber. Next, the payoﬀ threshold θ1 t− 1(i) is set by θ1 t− 1(i) = findα ({zt− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}), where the function findα (·) is to ﬁnd the α-th largest payoﬀ in a set that contains all neighbors’ payoﬀs of the data point. When the LRR fun ction L1 i(·) is applied, the links connecting to the neighbors with small payoﬀs are removed and meanwhile new links are created between the data point and foun d players with higher payoﬀs. Hence, according to Eq.(13), the new neighbor set is Γ t(i) = L1 i(ˆzt− 1(i)). Unlike the LRR function L1 i(·), the LRR function L2 i(·) adjusts the number of neighbors dynamically instead of the constant number of neighbo rs in L1 i(·). Therefore, the payoﬀ threshold θ2 t− 1(i) takes the average of neighbors’ payoﬀs, θ2 t− 1(i) = ∑ j∈ Γ t− 1(i) zt− 1(i)/ |Γ t− 1(i)|. Next, the set Γ + t− 1(i) is formed according to Eq.(13), Γ + t− 1(i) = {j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θ2 t− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}, and then the new neigh- bor set is achieved by means of the LRR\n",

Therefore, the payoﬀ threshold θ2 t− 1(i) takes the average of neighbors’ payoﬀs, θ2 t− 1(i) = ∑ j∈ Γ t− 1(i) zt− 1(i)/ |Γ t− 1(i)|. Next, the set Γ + t− 1(i) is formed according to Eq.(13), Γ + t− 1(i) = {j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θ2 t− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}, and then the new neigh- bor set is achieved by means of the LRR function L2 i(·), Γ t(i) = L2 i(ˆzt− 1(i)). In the case, when the payoﬀs of all neighbors are equal to the pay oﬀ thresh- old θ2 t− 1(i), the output of the LRR function is Γ t(i) = Γ t− 1(i). This may be viewed as self-protective behavior for avoiding a payoﬀ loss due to n o enough information acquired. The LRR function Li(·) expands the view of a player X i, i.e., it makes him observe payoﬀs of players in the extended neighbor set, which pro vides a chance to ﬁnd players with higher payoﬀs around him. If no players with highe r payoﬀs are found in the extended neighbor set, namely min({zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}) ≥ max({zt− 1(h),h ∈ Υ t− 1(i)}), then the output of the LRR function is Γ t(i) = Γ t− 1(i). Otherwise, players with small payoﬀs will be removed together wit h the corresponding links from the neighbor set and link set, and replaced by some found players with higher payoﬀ.

This idea is totally diﬀer ent from traditional clustering algorithms, such as Kmeans and its variants, because in traditional clustering algorithms data points for clustering are ﬁxe d, and various functions or methods are designed to ﬁnd cluster centers or sepa rating hyper- planes, whereas in the quantum-game-based clustering algorithms data points (players) themselves choose their clusters, which leads clusters a re formed au- tomatically during quantum games. In conclusion, traditional cluste ring algo- rithms do it from outside, while ours are from inside. Furthermore, o ur algo- rithms do not need to choose cluster centers at beginning, so ther e does not exist the problem that is ”sensitive to the selection of the initial partition” . Besides, distances between data points are commonly used as the measurem ent of their similarities in the Kmeans algorithm and its variants. However, when sim ilar- ities are measured in our algorithms, not only distances between dat a points but also their degrees and the strength of links are integrated, wh ich provides more information for the measurement of similarities. Later, accor ding to pay- oﬀs in quantum games, players apply a LRR function to change the st ructure of the network, which makes the clusters emerge. As a result, bet ter clustering accuracies are obtained by our algorithms. Table 5 displays the clustering accuracies of our algorithms and the o ther 15three algorithms using the datasets\n",

Table 5 displays the clustering accuracies of our algorithms and the o ther 15three algorithms using the datasets in Table 4. It can be observed t hat on almost all datasets the quantum game based clustering algorithms h ave the best clustering accuracies. Only on the Iris dataset, the LDA-Km a lgorithm is better than ours, but our result is close to it as well. The Iris datase t contains three clusters, one of which is far from the other two, so data poin ts in it can be clustered easily and correctly. The other clusters in the Iris dataset, however, are mixed partly in their boundaries, which brings a diﬃculty for clustering. These mixed boundary points may be assigned to diﬀeren t clusters by algorithms, which is why the clustering accuracies of algorithms ar e various. It is more diﬃcult to cluster data points in the Sonar and Ionosphere dataset, because in these two datasets plenty of data points belonging to diﬀ erent clusters are mixed together. Therefore, the clustering accuracies of algo rithms in them are not high, and it is rather hard to improve the clustering accurac ies even by several percents. From the\n",

Later, the Grover iteration G is employed to update the strength of links between him and his neighbors. In the process of playing quantum game, the s tructure of the network formed by players tends to stability gradually. In ot her words, each player always connects to one of his neighbors with the largest strength or jumps among some neighbors with the largest strength in a constan t period.

In this paper, we combine the quantum gam e with the problem of data clustering, and then develop a quantum-g ame-based clustering algorithm, in which data points in a dataset are c onsidered as players who can make decisions and implement quantum stra tegies in quantum games. After each round of a quantum game, each playe r’s ex- pected payoﬀ is calculated. Later, he uses an link-removing -and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust the streng th of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoﬀ. Further, a lgorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two pa yoﬀ ma- trixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered rea sonably and eﬃciently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provid es an indica- tion of the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach.

More recently, an increasing number of researchers with diﬀerent backgrounds, ranging from physics, computer sciences and information theory t o mathematics and philosophy, are involved in researching properties of quantum- based com- putation [1]. During the last decade, a series of signiﬁcant breakthr oughs had been made. One was that in 1994 Peter Shor surprised the world by p roposing a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for integer factorization [2], while in the classical world the best-known classical factoring algorithm works in superpoly- nomial time. Three years later, in 1997, Lov Grover proved that a q uantum computer could search an unsorted database in the square root o f the time [3]. Meanwhile, Gilles Brassard et al. combined ideas from Grover’s and Sho r’s quantum algorithms to propose a quantum counting algorithm [4]. 1In recent years, many interests focus on the quantum game theo ry and con- siderable work has been done. For instance, D. A. Meyer [5] studied the Penny Flip game in the quantum world ﬁrstly. His result showed that if a player was allowed to implement quantum strategies, he would always defeat his o pponent who played the classical strategies and increase his expected payo ﬀ as well. J. Eisert et al. [6] quantized the Prisoners’ Dilemma and demonstrated that the dilemma could be escaped when both players resort to quantum stra tegies. A. P. Flitney et al. [7] generalized Eisert’s result, the miracle move, i.e., th e result of the game would move towards the quantum player’s preferred re sult, while the other player used classical strategies. L. Marinatto et al. [8] in vestigated the Battle of the Sexes game in quantum domain. Their result showed tha t there existed a unique equilibrium in the game, when the entangled strategie s were allowed. C. F. Lee et al. [9] reported that the quantum game is more eﬃcient than the classical game, and they found an upper bound for this eﬃ ciency. Be- sides, some experiments about the quantum games have also been im plemented on diﬀerent quantum computers [10, 11, 12]. For more details about quantum games, see [13]. Successes achieved by quantum algorithms make us guess that pow erful quantum computers can ﬁgure out solutions faster and better th an the best known classical counterparts for certain types of problems. Fur thermore, it is more important that they oﬀer a new way to ﬁnd potentially dramatic algorith- mic speed-ups. Therefore, we may ask naturally: can we construc t quantum versions of classical algorithms or present new quantum algorithms to solve the problems in pattern recognition faster and better on a quantu m computer? Following this idea, some researchers have proposed their novel me thods and demonstrated exciting results [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. In addition, data clustering is a main\n",

In addition, data clustering is a main branch of Pattern Recognition, which is widely used in many ﬁelds such as pattern analysis, data mining, infor ma- tion retrieval and image segmentation. In these ﬁelds, however, t here is usually little priori knowledge available about the data. In response to thes e restric- tions, clustering methodology come into being which is particularly suit able for the exploration of interrelationships among data points. Data clust ering is the formal study of algorithms and methods for grouping or classifying unlabeled data points [19]. In other words, its task is to ﬁnd the inherent stru cture of a given collection of unlabeled data points and group them into meaningf ul clus- ters [19]. In this paper, we attempt to combine the quantum game wit h the problem of data clustering in order to establish a novel clustering alg orithm based on quantum games. In our algorithms, unlabeled data points in a dataset are regarded as players who can make decisions in quantum games. O n a time- varying network formed by players, each player is permitted to use quantum strategies and plays a 2 × 2 entangled quantum game against every one of his neighbors respectively. Later, he applies a link-removing-and-rew iring (LRR) function to remove the links of neighbors with small payoﬀs and crea te new links to neighbors with higher payoﬀs at the same time. Furthermore, th e strength of links between a player and his neighbors is diﬀerent from one anoth er, which is updated by the Grover iteration. During quantum games, the str ucture of network and the strength of links between players tend toward st ability grad- ually. Finally, if each player only connects to the neighbor with the high est strength, the network will naturally divide into several separate p arts, each of which corresponds to a cluster. 2The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introdu ces some important concepts about the quantum computation and the quantum Prisoners’ Dilemma brieﬂy.

In quantum computation, the Boolean states 0 and 1 are r epresented by a prescribed pair of normalized and mutually orthogonal quantum st ates labeled as {|0⟩, |1⟩} to form a ’computational basis’ [20]. Any pure state of the qubit can be written as a superposition state α|0⟩+ β|1⟩ for some α and β satisfying |α|2 + |β|2 = 1 [20]. A collection of n qubits is called a quantum register of size n, which spans a Hilbert space of 2 n dimensions, so 2 n mutually orthogonal quantum states can be available. Quantum state preparations, and any other manipulations on qubit s, have to be performed by unitary operations. A quantum logic gate is a dev ice which performs a ﬁxed unitary operation on selected qubits in a ﬁxed perio d of time, and a quantum circuit is a device consisting of quantum logic gates who se com- putational steps are synchronized in time [20]. The most common qua ntum gate is the Hadamard gate, which acts on a qubit in state |0⟩ or |1⟩ to produce    |0⟩ H − → 1 √ 2 |0⟩+ 1√ 2 |1⟩ |1⟩ H − → 1√ 2 |0⟩ − 1√ 2 |1⟩ ,H = 1√ 2 ( 1 1 1−1 ) .

In this game, each of two player s has two optional strategies, cooperation (C) and defection (D). Lat er, he chooses one strategy against the other’s for maximizing his own payoﬀ, so do es the other side at the same time, but both sides do not know the opponent’s str ategy. As a result, each player receives a payoﬀ which depends on his selected strategy, where the payoﬀ matrix under diﬀerent strategy proﬁles is describ ed in Table 1. According to the classical game theory, the strategy proﬁle (def ection, defection) 3Table 1: Payoﬀ matrix for the Prisoners’ Dilemma. C = 0 D= 1 C = 0 R= 3 S = 0 D= 1 T = 5 P = 1 is the unique Nash Equilibrium [22, 23], but unfortunately it is not Paret o optimal [24]. In the quantum game, however, thanks to the quantum strategie s, the dilemma in the classical game can be escaped in a restricted strategic space [6]. The physical model of quantum Prisoners’ Dilemma presented by Eis ert [6] is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: The block diagram of the system. If the possible outcomes of the classical strategies, C = 0 and D = 1, are assigned to two basis vectors {|C = 0 ⟩, |D = 1 ⟩} in Hilbert space respectively, then at any time the state of the game may be represented by a vec tor in the space spanned by the basis {|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩} [6]. Assume the initial state of the game is |ψ0⟩ = ˆJ |00⟩, where ˆJ is an entangling operator which is known to both players. For a two-player game with two pure strategies, the general form of ˆJ may be written as [25, 26] ˆJ(γ) = exp(iγ 2 σ⊗ 2 x ) = I⊗ 2cosγ 2 + iσ⊗ 2 x sinγ 2 (2) where γ ∈ [0,π/ 2] is a measure of entanglement of a game. When γ = π/ 2, there is a maximally entangled game, in which the entangling operator t akes form ˆJ(γ) = 1√ 2 (I⊗ 2 + iσ⊗ 2 x ). (3) Next, each player chooses a unitary operator ˆY1( ˆY2) from the strategy space S1(S2) and operates it on the qubit that belongs to him, which makes the ga me in a state ( ˆY1 ⊗ ˆY2) ˆJ|00⟩. Speciﬁcally, the unitary operators ˆC and ˆD that correspond to the strategies, cooperation and defection, are g iven below [6] ˆC = (1 0 0 1 ) , ˆD= ( 0 1 −1 0 ) .

(5) Thus, the player’s expected payoﬀ is written as z= R|⟨ψf |00⟩|2 + S|⟨ψf |01⟩|2 + T|⟨ψf |10⟩|2 + P|⟨ψf |11⟩|2. (6) For more details, see [6, 27]. 43 Algorithm In the section, we will combine the model of the quantum game with th e problem of data clustering, and then establish clustering algorithms based on quantum games. Assume an unlabeled dataset X = {X 1, X 2, · · · , X N },which are distributed in a m-dimensional metric space. Each data point in the dataset is considered as a player in quantum games who can make decisions and always hope to maximize his payoﬀ. In the metric space, there is a distance f unction d : X × X − → R, satisfying the closer the two players are, the smaller the output is. Based on the distance function, a k nearest neighbors (knn) network as a weighted and directed network, G0(X ,E 0,d ), may be created among data points by adding k edges directed toward its k nearest neighbors for each player. Deﬁnition 1 If there is a set X with N players, X = {X1, X2, · · · , XN }, the weighted and directed knn network, G0(X,E 0,d ), is created as below.                  X = { Xi,i = 1 , 2, · · · ,N } E0 = ⋃ N i=1 E0(i) E0(i) = { e0 ( Xi, Xj ) | j ∈ Γ 0(i) } Γ 0(i) = { j ⏐ ⏐ ⏐j = argmink Xh∈ X ({ d(Xi, Xh), Xh ∈ X } )} (7) Here, each player in the set X corresponds to a vertex in the network G0(X,E 0,d ); E0 is a link set and a link in the network represents certain rela tionship between a pair of players; the distances denote the weights over link s; the function, argmink(·), is to ﬁnd k nearest neighbors of a player which construct a ne igh- bor set, Γ 0(i); the subscript ’0’ is the initial time step. It is worth noting that the strength of links between a player X i and his k nearest neighbors represented by ρt− 1(X i, X j ),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)(t ≥ 1) is time- varying, whose initial values is calculated by ρ0(X i, X j) = { 1/ |Γ 0(i)| = 1 /k, j ∈ Γ 0(i) 0, otherwise (8) where the symbol | · | denotes the cardinality of a set. After the initial connections are constructed among players (dat a points), on this weighted and directed knn network, a quantum game\n",

After the initial connections are constructed among players (dat a points), on this weighted and directed knn network, a quantum game can be d eﬁned as following. Deﬁnition 2A quantum game Ω = {X,G t,S,Z t} on a network Gt is a 4- tuple: X is a set of players; Gt represents the connections among players; S = {s(i),i = 1 , 2, · · · ,N } represents a set of players’ strategies including the full range of quantum strategies; Zt = {zt(i),i = 1 , 2, · · · ,N } represents a set of players’ expected payoﬀs. Here, the variable tdenotes the time step (the number of iterations).

In the classical 2 × 2 game, such as the Prisoners’ Dilemma, usually there are only two pure strategies, cooperation and defection, but in the quant um game, one can design diﬀerent unitary operators as strategies, i.e., the stra tegy set S may be identiﬁed with some subset of the group of 2 × 2 unitary matrices [6]. Here, for the purpose of clustering and simplifying computation, the stra tegy set of a player X i is restricted in a set S1 = { ˆH, ˆD} or S2 = { ˆFt− 1(i,j ), ˆD}, and then two cases of strategy sets are described respectively. Case 1: In this case, a player and his opponent can apply strategies inS1 = { ˆH, ˆD}. When a player X i use the Hadamard matrix ˆH as a strategy, his opponent (neighbor) X j has two optional strategies { ˆH, ˆD}, but which strategy is chosen is dependent on the strength of the link between them, as is a rule of the clustering algorithm. If the strength ρt− 1(X j , X i) equals to zero, i.e., there is no link directed from the player X j to the player X i, then the player X j will apply the strategy ’Defection’ ( ˆD). Alternatively, if ρt− 1(X j , X i) >0, namely mutual connections between them, the player X j implements the strategy ˆH.

When a player X i use the Hadamard matrix ˆH as a strategy, his opponent (neighbor) X j has two optional strategies { ˆH, ˆD}, but which strategy is chosen is dependent on the strength of the link between them, as is a rule of the clustering algorithm. If the strength ρt− 1(X j , X i) equals to zero, i.e., there is no link directed from the player X j to the player X i, then the player X j will apply the strategy ’Defection’ ( ˆD). Alternatively, if ρt− 1(X j , X i) >0, namely mutual connections between them, the player X j implements the strategy ˆH. If the initial state of the game is |ψ0⟩ = ˆJ|00⟩, by applying the model of the quantum game the ﬁnal state of the game is |ψf,j ⟩ = { 1 2 (|00⟩ − i|01⟩ − i|10⟩+ |11⟩), ˆH⊗ ˆH 1√ 2 (i|00⟩ − |01⟩), ˆH⊗ ˆD (9) Case 2: The strategy setS2 = { ˆFt− 1(i,j ), ˆD} is adopted in the case. The strategy ˆFt− 1(i,j ), ˆFt− 1(i,j ) = ( √ ρt− 1(X i, X j ) √ 1 − ρt− 1(X i, X j )√ 1 − ρt− 1(X i, X j ) − √ ρt− 1(X i, X j ) ) , is a general form of Hadamard matrix ˆH whose elements are associated with the strength of links ρt− 1(X i, X j ). When ρt− 1(X i, X j )=0.5, the strategy ˆFt− 1(i,j ) recovers the strategy ˆH. Similarly, the neighbor X j , when ρt− 1(X j , X i) = 0, applies the strategy ’Defection’ ( ˆD), while using the strategy ˆFt− 1(i,j ) when ρt− 1(X j , X i) > 0. If the initial state of the game is |ψ0⟩ = ˆJ|00⟩, after their moves, the ﬁnal state of the game is |ψf,j ⟩ =      √ ρ1ρ2|00⟩ − i √ ρ2(1 − ρ1)|01⟩ −i √ ρ1(1 − ρ2)|10⟩+ √ (1 − ρ1)(1 − ρ2)|11⟩, ˆFt− 1 ⊗ ˆFt− 1 i√1 − ρ1|00⟩ − √ρ1|01⟩, ˆFt− 1 ⊗ ˆD . (10) According to the payoﬀ matrix, the player’s expected payoﬀ can be computed by zt− 1(i) = ∑ j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) zt− 1(X i, X j ) = ∑ j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) R|⟨ψf,j |00⟩|2 + S|⟨ψf,j |01⟩|2 + T|⟨ψf,j |10⟩|2 + P|⟨ψf,j |11⟩|2. (11) 6In practice, the payoﬀ matrix takes PD-like or Snowdrift (SD)-like f orm, de- scribed in Table 2 and 3. In the PD-like payoﬀ matrix, the following inequ ali- Table 2: PD-like payoﬀ matrix.

To avoid a case that a player’s expected payoﬀ is zero, the variable S in Table 2 takes a small value instead of zero in Table 1. In addition, the Snowdrift game assumes that two drivers are blocked by a snowdrift, each of whom is in either side of the snowd rift. If they want to go back home, one of them or both must shovel a path through the snowdrift. So, there exists a cost c in the SD-like payoﬀ matrix and the following inequality holds: T > R > S > P[28], where c = β · ωt− 1(X i, X j ) and β\n",

The strategy ˆFt− 1(i,j ), ˆFt− 1(i,j ) = ( √ ρt− 1(X i, X j ) √ 1 − ρt− 1(X i, X j )√ 1 − ρt− 1(X i, X j ) − √ ρt− 1(X i, X j ) ) , is a general form of Hadamard matrix ˆH whose elements are associated with the strength of links ρt− 1(X i, X j ). When ρt− 1(X i, X j )=0.5, the strategy ˆFt− 1(i,j ) recovers the strategy ˆH. Similarly, the neighbor X j , when ρt− 1(X j , X i) = 0, applies the strategy ’Defection’ ( ˆD), while using the strategy ˆFt− 1(i,j ) when ρt− 1(X j , X i) > 0. If the initial state of the game is |ψ0⟩ = ˆJ|00⟩, after their moves, the ﬁnal state of the game is |ψf,j ⟩ =      √ ρ1ρ2|00⟩ − i √ ρ2(1 − ρ1)|01⟩ −i √ ρ1(1 − ρ2)|10⟩+ √ (1 − ρ1)(1 − ρ2)|11⟩, ˆFt− 1 ⊗ ˆFt− 1 i√1 − ρ1|00⟩ − √ρ1|01⟩, ˆFt− 1 ⊗ ˆD . (10) According to the payoﬀ matrix, the player’s expected payoﬀ can be computed by zt− 1(i) = ∑ j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) zt− 1(X i, X j ) = ∑ j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) R|⟨ψf,j |00⟩|2 + S|⟨ψf,j |01⟩|2 + T|⟨ψf,j |10⟩|2 + P|⟨ψf,j |11⟩|2. (11) 6In practice, the payoﬀ matrix takes PD-like or Snowdrift (SD)-like f orm, de- scribed in Table 2 and 3. In the PD-like payoﬀ matrix, the following inequ ali- Table 2: PD-like payoﬀ matrix. C = 0 D= 1 C = 0 R= 0 .6ωt− 1(X i, X j ) S = 0 .01ωt− 1(X i, X j ) D= 1 T = ωt− 1(X i, X j ) P = 0 .2ωt− 1(X i, X j ) Table 3: SD-like payoﬀ matrix.

To avoid a case that a player’s expected payoﬀ is zero, the variable S in Table 2 takes a small value instead of zero in Table 1. In addition, the Snowdrift game assumes that two drivers are blocked by a snowdrift, each of whom is in either side of the snowd rift. If they want to go back home, one of them or both must shovel a path through the snowdrift. So, there exists a cost c in the SD-like payoﬀ matrix and the following inequality holds: T > R > S > P[28], where c = β · ωt− 1(X i, X j ) and β is a proportional factor. Besides, the variable ωt− 1(X i, X j ) in two payoﬀ matrices is calculated by the formulation below. ωt− 1(X i, X j ) = ρt− 1(X i, X j ) × Degt− 1(X j )/d (X i, X j ) (12) 3.2 Design of LRR functions When all players’ payoﬀs have been computed, each player will obse rve his neighbors’ payoﬀs, and apply a link-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) f unction Li(·) to change his links. A LRR function is deﬁned as below. Deﬁnition 3The LRR function Li(·) is a function of payoﬀs, whose output is a set with k elements, namely an updated neighbor set Γ t(i) of a player Xi. It is given as below. Γ t(i) = Li ( ˆzt− 1(i) ) = argmaxk j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) S Υ t− 1(i) ({ zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) }) ˆzt− 1(i) = { zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) } , Υ t− 1(i) = ⋃ j∈ Γ + t− 1 (i) Γ t− 1(j) Γ + t− 1(i) = { j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θt− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) } , Γ − t− 1(i) = Γ t− 1(i)\\Γ + t− 1(i) (13) where θt− 1(i) is a payoﬀ threshold, Υ t− 1(i) is called an extended neighbor set, and the function argmaxk(·) is to ﬁnd k neighbors with the ﬁrst k largest payoﬀs in the set Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i). Here, two LRR functions L1 i(·) and L2 i(·) are designed. The function L1 i(·) always observes an extended neighbor set formed by half neighbor s of a data 7point X i, α = ⌈ 0.5 × | Γ t− 1(i)| ⌉ , where the symbol ⌈·⌉ is to take an integer part of a number satisfying the integer part is no larger than the nu mber. Next, the payoﬀ threshold θ1 t− 1(i) is set by θ1 t− 1(i) = findα ({zt− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}), where the function findα (·) is to ﬁnd the α-th largest payoﬀ in a set that contains all neighbors’ payoﬀs of the data point. When the LRR fun ction L1 i(·) is applied, the links connecting to the neighbors with small payoﬀs are removed and meanwhile new links are created between the data point and foun d players with higher payoﬀs. Hence, according to Eq.(13), the new neighbor set is Γ t(i) = L1 i(ˆzt− 1(i)). Unlike the LRR function L1 i(·), the LRR function L2 i(·) adjusts the number of neighbors dynamically instead of the constant number of neighbo rs in L1 i(·). Therefore, the payoﬀ threshold θ2 t− 1(i) takes the\n",

Besides, the variable ωt− 1(X i, X j ) in two payoﬀ matrices is calculated by the formulation below. ωt− 1(X i, X j ) = ρt− 1(X i, X j ) × Degt− 1(X j )/d (X i, X j ) (12) 3.2 Design of LRR functions When all players’ payoﬀs have been computed, each player will obse rve his neighbors’ payoﬀs, and apply a link-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) f unction Li(·) to change his links.

It is given as below. Γ t(i) = Li ( ˆzt− 1(i) ) = argmaxk j∈ Γ t− 1 (i) S Υ t− 1(i) ({ zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) }) ˆzt− 1(i) = { zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i) } , Υ t− 1(i) = ⋃ j∈ Γ + t− 1 (i) Γ t− 1(j) Γ + t− 1(i) = { j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θt− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i) } , Γ − t− 1(i) = Γ t− 1(i)\\Γ + t− 1(i) (13) where θt− 1(i) is a payoﬀ threshold, Υ t− 1(i) is called an extended neighbor set, and the function argmaxk(·) is to ﬁnd k neighbors with the ﬁrst k largest payoﬀs in the set Γ t− 1(i) ⋃ Υ t− 1(i). Here, two LRR functions L1 i(·) and L2 i(·) are designed. The function L1 i(·) always observes an extended neighbor set formed by half neighbor s of a data 7point X i, α = ⌈ 0.5 × | Γ t− 1(i)| ⌉ , where the symbol ⌈·⌉ is to take an integer part of a number satisfying the integer part is no larger than the nu mber. Next, the payoﬀ threshold θ1 t− 1(i) is set by θ1 t− 1(i) = findα ({zt− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}), where the function findα (·) is to ﬁnd the α-th largest payoﬀ in a set that contains all neighbors’ payoﬀs of the data point. When the LRR fun ction L1 i(·) is applied, the links connecting to the neighbors with small payoﬀs are removed and meanwhile new links are created between the data point and foun d players with higher payoﬀs. Hence, according to Eq.(13), the new neighbor set is Γ t(i) = L1 i(ˆzt− 1(i)). Unlike the LRR function L1 i(·), the LRR function L2 i(·) adjusts the number of neighbors dynamically instead of the constant number of neighbo rs in L1 i(·). Therefore, the payoﬀ threshold θ2 t− 1(i) takes the average of neighbors’ payoﬀs, θ2 t− 1(i) = ∑ j∈ Γ t− 1(i) zt− 1(i)/ |Γ t− 1(i)|. Next, the set Γ + t− 1(i) is formed according to Eq.(13), Γ + t− 1(i) = {j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θ2 t− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}, and then the new neigh- bor set is achieved by means of the LRR function L2 i(·), Γ t(i) = L2 i(ˆzt− 1(i)). In the case, when the payoﬀs of all neighbors are equal to the pay oﬀ thresh- old θ2 t− 1(i), the output of the LRR function is Γ t(i) = Γ t− 1(i). This may be viewed as self-protective behavior for avoiding a payoﬀ loss due to n o enough information acquired. The LRR function Li(·) expands the view of a player X i, i.e., it makes him observe payoﬀs of players in the extended neighbor set, which pro vides a chance to ﬁnd players with higher payoﬀs around him. If no players with highe r payoﬀs are found in the extended neighbor set, namely min({zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}) ≥ max({zt− 1(h),h ∈ Υ t− 1(i)}), then the output of the LRR function is Γ t(i) = Γ t− 1(i). Otherwise, players with small payoﬀs will be removed together wit h the corresponding links from the neighbor set and link set, and replaced by some found players with higher payoﬀ. This process is repeated till the pa yoﬀs of unlinked players in the extended neighbor set are no larger than tho se of linked neighbors. Since the links among players, namely the link set E0 in the network G0(X ,E 0,d ), are changed by the LRR function, the network Gt(X ,E t,d ) has begun to evolve over time, when t≥ 1.

Next, the set Γ + t− 1(i) is formed according to Eq.(13), Γ + t− 1(i) = {j|zt− 1(j) ≥ θ2 t− 1(i),j ∈ Γ t− 1(i)}, and then the new neigh- bor set is achieved by means of the LRR function L2 i(·), Γ t(i) = L2 i(ˆzt− 1(i)). In the case, when the payoﬀs of all neighbors are equal to the pay oﬀ thresh- old θ2 t− 1(i), the output of the LRR function is Γ t(i) = Γ t− 1(i). This may be viewed as self-protective behavior for avoiding a payoﬀ loss due to n o enough information acquired.

First, he ﬁnds a neighbor X m with maximal payoﬀ in his neighbor set, m= argmax j∈ Γ t(i) ({ zt− 1(j),j ∈ Γ t(i) }) (16) Next, the strength of link ρt(X i, X j ),j ∈ Γ t(i) is taken its square root and the player X m’s strength of the link becomes negative, { {√ ρt(X i, X j ),j ∈ Γ t(i) } √ ρt(X i, X m) = − √ ρt(X i, X m),m ∈ Γ t(i) (17) Further, let Avet(i) = ( ∑ j∈ Γ t(i) √ ρt(X i, X m))/ |Γ t(i)|, thus, the updated strength of link is ρt(X i, X j ) = ( 2 × Avet(i) − √ ρt(X i, X j ) ) 2 ,j ∈ Γ t(i). (18) The above-mentioned method is a variant of the Grover iteration G in the quantum search algorithm [3], a well-known algorithm in quantum compu tation, which is a way to adjust the probability amplitude of each term in a supe rposi- tion state. By adjustment, the probability amplitude of the wanted is increased, while the others are reduced. This whole process may be regarded a s the in- version about average operation [3]. For our case, each strength of link is taken its square root ﬁrst, and then the average Avet(i) of square roots is computed. Finally, all values are inverted about the average. There are three main reasons that we select the modiﬁed Grover iteration to update the strengt h of links: (a) the sum of updated strength of links retains one, ∑ j∈ Γ t(i) ρt(X i, X j ) = 1, (b) certain strength of links between a player and his neighbors is much la rger than the others, ρt(X i, X j ) ≫ ρt(X i, X h),h ∈ Γ t(i)\\j, after the strength of links is updated, and (c) it helps players’ payoﬀs to follow a power law distr ibution, in which only a few players’ payoﬀs are far larger than others’ in the end of iterations. Besides, the process that all players adjust their strength is ord er irrelevant, because the strength of links of all players is updated synchronou sly, and the network is a directed network, so the strength cannot be overrid den by other players. When the strength of links of each player has been update d, an iteration is completed. In conclusion, when t≥ 1 , the structure of network representing connections among players begins to evolve over time. 4 Discussions In the section, ﬁrstly, the relationship\n",

Finally, the total payoﬀs based on two diﬀerent payoﬀ matrices are compared and the relationship between the tot al payoﬀs and the rates of convergence of algorithms is explained. 94.1 Number of nearest neighbors vs. number of clusters The number k of nearest neighbors represents the number of neighbors to which a data point (player) X i ∈ X connects. For a dataset, the number k of nearest neighbors determines the number of clusters in part. G enerally speaking, the number of clusters decreases inversely with the num ber k of nearest neighbors. For example, when the number k of nearest neighbors is small, it is indicated that the player X i connects to only a few neighbors. At this time only those not-too-distance neighbors can be observed by the LRR fu nction, which means that the elements in the union of the extended neighbor set Υ t− 1(i) and the neighbor set Γ t− 1(i) are few. Therefore, when the evolution of the network formed by players is ended, many small clusters are established amo ng data points. On the other hand, a big number k of nearest neighbors provides more neighbors for each player, as speciﬁes that the cardinality of the u nion is larger than that when a small k is taken. This means that more neighbors can be observed and explored by the LRR function, so that big clusters co ntaining more data points are formed. For a dataset, the clustering results at the diﬀerent number k of nearest neighbors have been illustrated in Fig. 2, in which each data point only c onnects to one of its neighbors who has the largest strength of link, and clus ters are represented by diﬀerent signs. As is shown in Fig. 2, it can be found t hat only a few data points receive considerable links, whereas most of da ta points have only one link.

This means that more neighbors can be observed and explored by the LRR function, so that big clusters co ntaining more data points are formed. For a dataset, the clustering results at the diﬀerent number k of nearest neighbors have been illustrated in Fig. 2, in which each data point only c onnects to one of its neighbors who has the largest strength of link, and clus ters are represented by diﬀerent signs. As is shown in Fig. 2, it can be found t hat only a few data points receive considerable links, whereas most of da ta points have only one link. This implies that when the structure of network te nds to stability, the network, if only the links with the largest strength are remained, is characterized by the scale-free network [29], i.e., winner takes all. Besides, in Fig. 2(a), six clusters are obtained by the clustering algorithm, whe n k= 9. As the number k of nearest neighbors rises, four clusters are obtained when k= 12, three clusters when k= 16. So, if the exact number of clusters is not known in advance, diﬀerent numbers of clusters may be achieved by adjust ing the number of nearest neighbors in practice. −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 (a) k = 9 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 (b) k = 12 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 5 −5 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 4 (c) k = 16 Figure 2: The number of nearest neighbors vs. number of clusters .

Therefore, the proportio nal factor β is restricted in an interval (0 , 0.5]. However, diﬀerent costs will bring about 10the changes of the payoﬀ matrix, which means that diﬀerent cluste ring results will be produced even in the same algorithm. Figure 3 illustrates how th e clustering results change at the diﬀerent number k of nearest neighbors when the proportional factor β takes diﬀerent values, in which the clustering results are represented by clustering accuracies. The deﬁnition of cluste ring accuracy is given below. Deﬁnition 4clusteri is the label which is assigned to a data point Xi in a dataset by the algorithm, and labeli is the actual label of the data point Xi in the dataset. So the clustering accuracy is [30]: accuracy = PN i=1 λ ( map(clusteri ),label i ) N λ(map(clusteri),label i) = { 1 if map(clusteri) = labeli 0 otherwise (19) where the mapping function map(·) maps the label got by the algorithm to the actual label.

Besides, in Fig. 2(a), six clusters are obtained by the clustering algorithm, whe n k= 9. As the number k of nearest neighbors rises, four clusters are obtained when k= 12, three clusters when k= 16.

However, diﬀerent costs will bring about 10the changes of the payoﬀ matrix, which means that diﬀerent cluste ring results will be produced even in the same algorithm. Figure 3 illustrates how th e clustering results change at the diﬀerent number k of nearest neighbors when the proportional factor β takes diﬀerent values, in which the clustering results are represented by clustering accuracies. The deﬁnition of cluste ring accuracy is given below. Deﬁnition 4clusteri is the label which is assigned to a data point Xi in a dataset by the algorithm, and labeli is the actual label of the data point Xi in the dataset. So the clustering accuracy is [30]: accuracy = PN i=1 λ ( map(clusteri ),label i ) N λ(map(clusteri),label i) = { 1 if map(clusteri) = labeli 0 otherwise (19) where the mapping function map(·) maps the label got by the algorithm to the actual label. Clustering accuracy is an important evaluation criterion for clustering algo- rithms, which reﬂects the level of matches between the actual lab els in a dataset and the labels assigned by a clustering algorithm, so that the goal of a clustering algorithm is to obtain higher clustering accuracies. As is shown in Figure 3, it can be seen that similar results are obtained b y the algorithm at diﬀerent costs, and the best results are produce d when k = 7 and k= 8, but from the Figure 3(b), the clustering result with the largest mean and the least variance is yielded when β = 0 .3.

If all other conditions are ﬁxed, an algorithm will form two versions d ue to using PD- or SD-like payoﬀ matrix, and naturally this will bring diﬀerent results. As compared with the PD-like payoﬀ matrix, the payoﬀ P and S in the SD-like payoﬀ matrix have a reverse order in the payoﬀ inequality. In all algo rithms, the relationship between the total payoﬀs and the number of iteration s is drawn in Figure 4. From Figure 4, it can be found that the total payoﬀs in the algorithms with SD-like payoﬀ matrix are larger than that of the algorithms with P D-like payoﬀ matrix no matter which LRR function is selected. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 number of iterations total payoffs QGC1PDL1 QGC1SDL1 QGC2PDL1 QGC2SDL1(a) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 number of iterations total payoffs QGC1PDL2 QGC1SDL2 QGC2PDL2 QGC2SDL2(b) Figure 4: The total payoﬀs vs. the rates of convergence.

For example, the name of an algorithm, QGC1PDL1, denotes that the Case 1, PD-like payoﬀ matrix and the LRR function L1 i(·) are employed in this algorithm. According to two payoﬀ matrices, using Eq.(11), each player’s expe cted pay- oﬀ can be calculated in two cases of strategies respectively as below .

Therefor e, this explains why diﬀerences between total payoﬀs are produced. Besides, Figure 4 not only describes the changes of total payoﬀs o f algo- rithms, but also reﬂects the rates of convergence of algorithms. When the total payoﬀs remain constant or ﬂuctuate slightly, this means that the a lgorithms have converged. At this time, players do not frequently apply the L RR function to change his neighbors but reach a stable state.

As mentioned in th e section 3.2, the LRR function L2 i(·) only can observe an extended neighbor set formed by those larger-than-average neighbors in contrast to an exten ded neighbor set built by half neighbors in the LRR function L1 i(·). Generally speaking, for the same k, the median of payoﬀs is smaller than or equal to the mean, i.e., θ1 t− 1 ≤ θ2 t− 1, which means that the exploring area of the LRR function L1 i(·) is larger than that of the LRR function L2 i(·). So, as a whole, the algorithms with the LRR function L2 i(·) are slightly faster than that with the LRR function L1 i(·), i.e., the number of iterations that the former type of algorithms n eeds is a little less. Furthermore, in the algorithms, a phenomenon that the strategie s ˆH and ˆFt− 1 are more likely used by players in a high density area while the strategy ˆD is used by those in a low density area is always observed. This is becaus e usually they are mutually neighbors in the high density area on the weig hted and directed knn network, but in the low density area this case is rev erse. As a result, the diﬀerences of payoﬀs between the high density and low d ensity areas are enlarged rapidly for the expected payoﬀ in the strategy proﬁle ( ˆH, ˆH) or ( ˆFt− 1, ˆFt− 1) is higher than that in other strategy proﬁle, and this also cause th e distribution of players’ payoﬀs follows a power-law distribution, whic h is why algorithms converge fast. 5 Simulations To evaluate these clustering algorithms, six datasets are selected from UCI repository [31], which are Soybean, Iris, Wine, Sonar, Ionosphere and Breast cancer Wisconsin datasets, and complete the simulations on them.

Next, the initial network representing relations among data points are creat ed according to Def.1, after a distance function is selected, which only needs to s atisfy that the more similar data points are, the smaller the output of the funct ion is.

As is analyzed in section 4.1, for a dataset the number k of clusters decreases inversely with the number of nearest neighbors. When a small k is selected, it is possible that the number of clusters is larger than the preset number of the dataset, after the algorit hm is ended. So a merging-subroutine is called to merge unwanted clusters, which wo rks in this way. At ﬁrst, the cluster with the fewest data points is identiﬁed, a nd then it is merged to the cluster whose distance between their centroids is sm allest. This subroutine is repeated till the number of clusters is equal to the pr eset number. The clustering results obtained by these algorithms are compared in Fig. 5, in which each point represents a clustering accuracy. As is shown in F ig. 5, the similar results are obtained by these algorithms at diﬀerent number o f nearest neighbors, but almost all the best results are obtained by the algor ithms using the LRR function L1 i(·). Further, we show a simple comparison with three other algorithms: K means [32, 33], PCA-Kmeans [33], LDA-Km [33]. The Kmeans algorithm is a popular clu s- tering algorithm because it is easy to implement.

So a merging-subroutine is called to merge unwanted clusters, which wo rks in this way. At ﬁrst, the cluster with the fewest data points is identiﬁed, a nd then it is merged to the cluster whose distance between their centroids is sm allest. This subroutine is repeated till the number of clusters is equal to the pr eset number. The clustering results obtained by these algorithms are compared in Fig. 5, in which each point represents a clustering accuracy. As is shown in F ig. 5, the similar results are obtained by these algorithms at diﬀerent number o f nearest neighbors, but almost all the best results are obtained by the algor ithms using the LRR function L1 i(·). Further, we show a simple comparison with three other algorithms: K means [32, 33], PCA-Kmeans [33], LDA-Km [33]. The Kmeans algorithm is a popular clu s- tering algorithm because it is easy to implement. It begins with k randomly- chosen cluster centers, and then assigns each data point in a data set to the closest cluster center.

The PCA-Kmeans algorithm consists of two steps : (1) Re- duce the data dimension by principal component analysis (PCA); (2) Clustering data points by the Kmeans algorithm. Ding et al combine linear discrimin ant analysis (LDA) with the Kmeans algorithm, and construct a new clust ering algorithm called ’LDA-Km’. In the LDA-Km algorithm, Kmeans is used to generate class labels, while LDA is used to do subspace selection. Finally, in the subspace selection process, data points are clustered. Our algorithms are established on the model of quantum games, so d ata points in datasets are considered as players. This idea is totally diﬀer ent from traditional clustering algorithms, such as Kmeans and its variants, because in traditional clustering algorithms data points for clustering are ﬁxe d, and various functions or methods are designed to ﬁnd cluster centers or sepa rating hyper- planes, whereas in the quantum-game-based clustering algorithms data points (players) themselves choose their clusters, which leads clusters a re formed au- tomatically during quantum games.

Later, accor ding to pay- oﬀs in quantum games, players apply a LRR function to change the st ructure of the network, which makes the clusters emerge. As a result, bet ter clustering accuracies are obtained by our algorithms. Table 5 displays the clustering accuracies of our algorithms and the o ther 15three algorithms using the datasets in Table 4. It can be observed t hat on almost all datasets the quantum game based clustering algorithms h ave the best clustering accuracies.

The Iris datase t contains three clusters, one of which is far from the other two, so data poin ts in it can be clustered easily and correctly. The other clusters in the Iris dataset, however, are mixed partly in their boundaries, which brings a diﬃculty for clustering. These mixed boundary points may be assigned to diﬀeren t clusters by algorithms, which is why the clustering accuracies of algorithms ar e various. It is more diﬃcult to cluster data points in the Sonar and Ionosphere dataset, because in these two datasets plenty of data points belonging to diﬀ erent clusters are mixed together. Therefore, the clustering accuracies of algo rithms in them are not high, and it is rather hard to improve the clustering accurac ies even by several percents.

Therefore , we combine the quantum game with the problem of data clustering, and establish clustering algorithms based on quantum games. In the algorithms, data points for clus- tering are regarded as players who can make decisions in quantum ga mes. On a weighted and directed knn network that represents relations am ong players, each player uses quantum strategies against every one of his neigh bors in a 2 × 2 entangled quantum game respectively. We design two cases of stra tegies: (i) one plays the strategy ˆH, the other plays the strategy ˆH or ˆD, (ii) one plays the strategy ˆFt− 1, the other plays the strategy ˆFt− 1 or ˆD according to the strength of links, in each of which players’ expected payoﬀs are calculated ba sed on the PD- and SD-like payoﬀ matrices respectively. According to neighbor s’ payoﬀs in one’s neighbor set, each player applies a LRR function ( L1 i(·) or L2 i(·)) to change his neighbors, i.e., the links connecting to neighbors with small payoﬀs 16are removed and then new links are created to those with higher pay oﬀs. Later, the Grover iteration G is employed to update the strength of links between him and his neighbors. In the process of playing quantum game, the s tructure of the network formed by players tends to stability gradually. In ot her words, each player always connects to one of his neighbors with the largest strength or jumps among some neighbors with the largest strength in a constan t period. At this time, if only the links with the largest strength are left but all oth er links are removed among players, the network naturally divides into seve ral separate parts, each of which corresponds to a cluster.
